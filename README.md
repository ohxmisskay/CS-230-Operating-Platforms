# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The client is The Gaming Room which develops web-based games. The client requests us to expand on developing web-based software for their game, Draw It or Lose It. Currently, the game is only available on the Android app, but it wishes to have the game serve on multiple platforms, such as Mac, Windows, Linux, and other mobile devices.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

When developing the documentation for the client, I excelled at creating a clear and concise recommendation that outlines how to address their software requirements. The documentation also clarifies the evaluation of the pros and cons of each operating platform and mobile devices.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

When developing the code, the Domain Model was the most helpful in processing the design document. Looking at the UML class diagram provided essential information on how to structure the project’s functionality. Also, the UML diagram helped to determine the relationship between each entity’s attributes.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I want to modify the evaluation portion because of how messy it looks. I want to improve it by including bullet points and bold fonts for readability. I would also like to be more thorough and expand on how each operating system and mobile device can be better considered when looking at the client’s point of view.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

I interpreted the user’s need and implanted it into the software design by putting myself in the user’s perspective and thinking of what would make the user continue to play. Understanding the user’s needs is essential because the users are responsible for the traffic and use of the product. By aiming to provide a positive experience for users, it leads to loyalty to the product and the expansion of the product’s popularity through word of mouth.  

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

My approach to designing software is to start simple and determine what are the objectives and which require priority. From there, it would be to focus on increments of the tasks by using creativity and problem-solving skills to outline key pieces to meet the requirements. At every update, I recommend testing the function in case of backtracking and logging down all pass or fail tests to move forward into the project. All these techniques and strategies listed will be used in the future the functionality of the project will be easier to maintain once it has been released.
